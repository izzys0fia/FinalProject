      <h1 id="making-a-list">Making A List</h1>
	  <p>Choosing the right college starts with making a thoughtful list of schools that interest you. This list doesn’t have to be perfect or final — it’s just a way to begin narrowing down your options. As you explore different campuses, programs, and environments, your list will probably change, and that’s okay. Starting with a few schools that match your goals, preferences, and priorities will help make the college search process feel more manageable and focused.</p>

          <h2>Preferences</h2>
          <img src="pref.jpg" alt="Female student writing on paper" />
          <p>Think about what kind of college experience you want. Do you prefer a big university or a smaller campus? Do you want to be close to home or farther away? Your personal preferences — like location, size, campus vibe, and extracurriculars — will help shape your list and make sure you’re looking at schools that feel like a good fit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="school-card">
          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <img src="req.jpg" alt="Mother and daughter sitting and talking" />
          <p>Every school has its own set of admissions requirements, like GPA, test scores, and coursework. Make sure the colleges on your list are a realistic match for your academic background. It’s smart to include a mix of reach, match, and safety schools to keep your options open.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="school-card">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <img src="resa.jpg" alt="Female student looking at a computer while writing" />
          <p>Once you have an idea of what you're looking for, take time to learn more about each school. Visit websites, watch virtual tours, and look into majors, support services, and student life. The more you know, the easier it’ll be to figure out which schools truly align with your goals.</p>

    <div class="main-section centered-text">
      <h1 id="final-decision">The Final Decision</h1>
	  <p>After all the applications, research, and waiting, it’s time to decide where you’ll actually go. This step can feel exciting and overwhelming at the same time. You’ll want to consider everything you've learned along the way — from campus visits to financial aid offers — and think carefully about where you’ll feel most supported and successful. It’s not just about the “best” school on paper, but the one that’s right for you.</p>

      <div class="school-gallery">
        <div class="school-card">
          <h2>Visiting</h2>
          <img src="visit.jpg" alt="Group of students being led on a tour" />
          <p>If you can, visiting campuses in person can make a big difference. Walking around, sitting in on a class, or just observing students can give you a real feel for the environment. Sometimes being on campus helps confirm your choice — or helps you realize it’s not the right fit after all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="school-card">
          <h2>Comparisons</h2>
          <img src="compare.jpg" alt="Mother and daughter sitting and discussing" />
          <p>Once you have your acceptances, take time to compare them side by side. Look beyond the name or reputation and think about cost, location, programs, and campus culture. Making a chart or list can help you see which schools really line up with what matters most to you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="school-card">
          <h2>Staying True</h2>		
          <img src="true.jpg" alt="Female student smiling at a computer with headphones" />
          <p>At the end of the day, the final decision should reflect what you want and need. It’s easy to feel pressure from parents, friends, or rankings, but you’re the one who will be living this experience. Trust your instincts and choose the school where you believe you’ll thrive — academically, personally, and emotionally.</p>
